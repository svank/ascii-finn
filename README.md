# ASCII FInn

Enabling superior research everywhere
### Enabling superior research everywhere

This includes four script files:

+ `finn`, which will print a random ASCII image of Finn
	+ Include the name of an ASCII image on the command line to print that one specifically
+ `finnsay`, `finnthink`, and `finnshout`, which will print Finn with a custom message in a speech bubble
	+ Usage: `finnshout SyntaxError on line 22!`
	+ These three require `cowsay` to be installed on your system (`sudo apt install cowsay` in Ubuntu)

To enable, I recommend either including this repository's directory in your PATH, or symlinking the executables to a directory in your path (e.g. ~/bin).
